# Crime-Map-Wizard
This tool was written to help the volunteers at the Kalispell Police Department update the Kalispell Crime Heatmap quickly and easily, no more copy/pasting in Excel, and no need to open ArcGIS Pro.

Crime Map Wizard is a newer version of the Crime Map Update Assistant that provides a graphical wizard with the previous three geoprocessing scripts improved and condensed into a single script.  The user interface is written in C++ using wxWidgets, and the geoprocessing script is written in Python using the ArcGIS ArcPy module.
